Lattice-Based SNARGs over libsnark
================================================================================

This is a prototype implementation of a lattice-based succinct non-interactive
argument (SNARG) built on top of the [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark)
library. All of the code is released under the MIT License (see
the [LICENSE] file).

**Note**: This implementation
has been subsumed by the paper [Shorter and Faster Post-Quantum Designated-Verifier zkSNARKs from Lattices](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/977)
(Yuval Ishai, Hang Su, and David J. Wu)
from ACM CCS 2021. Please refer to the
[lattice-zksnark Github repository](https://github.com/lattice-based-zkSNARKs/lattice-zksnark)
for the current implementation of lattice-based designated-verifier zkSNARKs.

**Warning:** This code is intended as a research prototype and a proof-of-concept
implementation of a lattice-based SNARG. It is not intended to be used in
critical or production-level systems.
